## History

I have come from a background of SQL server and serving critical support on terabyte scale databases, but then transitioned into a full-stack developer role, and more recently taken up technical leadership positions.

In most cases, my work has been B2B focused, and a detailed understanding of those domain experts has been essential.

Keeping the developer experience frictionless is always a priority for me, alongside in general empowering developers to take ownership and responsibility for their work.

I'm proud to be at the front of a team, encouraging, growing and learning with a diverse and talented group.
