## History
I have come from a background of SQL server and serving critical support on terabyte scale databases, but have transitioned into a full-stack developer role over 5 years, with Mongo/Node/Vue as my bread and butter.

More recently, I've become skilled in a cloud based stack, including Node Server functions, Hasura backed GraphQL/Postgres and communicating with ML via message services.

I'm proud to be at the front of a team, encouraging, growing and learning with a diverse and talented group.
