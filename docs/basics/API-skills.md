## Skills

Primarily skilled in Node, React and Typescript. I always carefully choose the tool to fit the project and circumstances, whether it be Jupyter notebooks for traceable scripting, Postgres plugins before custom solutions, or C# for game development.

You might describe me as an "incrementalist" - i like to deliver quickly and in increments, sticking closely to Agile values and letting feedback steer me.

I feed this on to my team too. My 1:1s are considerated and structured, and form a great basis for the performance reviews.
