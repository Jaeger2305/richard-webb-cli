## Key traits

**Communicator** ‚Äì I‚Äôm quick to jump to a whiteboard, I‚Äôm always ready to share some ideas over a coffee, and I‚Äôm good at bringing people together. I bridge the gap between the technical implementation and non-technical stakeholders.
**Programmer at heart** ‚Äì I am comfortable getting stuck into challenging problems, coming up with creative and pragmatic solutions in and outside of a code base. No problem can withstand the barrage of sustained coffee drinking and a debugging session.
Fully engaged ‚Äì I thoroughly enjoy my work, and I often have experiments or plans in a
notebook somewhere to allow me to go above and beyond the normal deliverable or job
description.

## Interests and activities

I am a keen indoor climber and outdoor hiker, though I rarely miss a weekend with friends strategizing over a complex board game. Otherwise, I‚Äôve nearly always got a hobby game development project on the go, and any remaining time goes on improving my German.
