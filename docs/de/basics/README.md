## Key traits

**Communicator** ‚Äì The best part of the job for me is sharing ideas over a whiteboard, video call or post-it notes over lunch. I have experience bridging the gap between the technical implementation and the stakeholders, and I‚Äôm often a volunteer to investigate and present on a new technology.

**Programmer at heart** ‚Äì I am comfortable getting stuck into challenging problems, coming up with creative and pragmatic solutions. No problem can withstand the barrage of sustained coffee drinking and a debugging session.

**Fully engaged** ‚Äì I thoroughly enjoy my work, and I often have experiments or plans in a notebook somewhere to allow me to go above and beyond the normal deliverable or job description. Previous examples of this have been improving the accessibility of the company website, improving standards, and hosting lunchtime conference videos.

**Beginner level German** ‚Äì A2 and actively learning, Netflix subtitles can take me only so far. 

## Interests and activities

üèïÔ∏èüßóü•æü•Åüá©üá™üíª

I am a keen indoor climber, outdoor hiker, and spend free weekends camping somewhere in the wilderness. Pre-corona times, I developed an ad-hoc music group with friends where I played whatever is needed between a guitar, a Cajon or piano. Generally, I am always keen to learn new things, challenge myself and meet new people.
